# mb10-midi-blaster-teardown
Teardown media of the Creative Midi Blaster MB-10 external synthesizer.

This repository contains the photos and ROMS dumped from the MB-10. Also contains a max-notes Python project to generate MIDI files to test the maximum number of tones that can be played simultaneously.

## Generate Midi for max tones test

This Python script generates a MIDI file that can be used to test the maximum number of tones that can be played simultaneously by the MB-10 and SC-55mkII.

Creative MB-10 vs Roland SC-55mkII: Max Tone Limit test (02:56)

An initial canary high-pitch tone is played followed by a pyramid of notes that climb up then down. Number of filler notes can be specified as a command line argument.

By default, the canary note is played on the first channel with the filler note played on the second channel. With the `--priority-override` flag, the canary note is played on the last channel with the filler note played on the first channel.

Once the device's maximum number of tones is reached, the initial canary note will be cut off.

This Python code is vibe-coded generated by Gemini.

```bash

# One time install of Midi Util library
pip install midiutil

# Generate test midi files by providing the number of filler notes on top of initial canary note and the filename
# 20 notes after the initial canary note
python gen_pyramid_canary_mid.py 20 filler20.mid
# 20 notes after the initial canary note
python gen_pyramid_canary_mid.py 30 filler30.mid
# 30 notes after the initial canary note with priority override
python gen_pyramid_canary_mid.py 30 filler30.mid --priority-override
```
